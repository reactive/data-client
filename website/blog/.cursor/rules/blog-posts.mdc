## Naming Convention

Files: `YYYY-MM-DD-vX.Y-short-description.md`

## Frontmatter

- Title format: `vX.Y: Feature1, Feature2, Feature3` or `vX.Y Feature-focused Title`
- Include `releases` tag plus relevant feature tags from [tags.yml](./tags.yml)
- `draft: true` for unpublished/WIP posts

## Package Layers

Organize content by package layer. Both feature sections and migration guides follow this order:

| Layer | Packages | Content |
|-------|----------|---------|
| **Platforms** | Integration | NextJS, Expo, React Native, Vue, React versions |
| **Client/Platform** | react, vue, core | Hooks, composables, Controller, Managers, Provider |
| **API Definition** | rest, endpoint, graphql | Resource, RestEndpoint, Entity, Collection, schemas |
| **Internal** | normalizr, core | State structure, normalization, typing |

## Blog Structure

**Summary (before `<!-- truncate -->`):**
1. Platforms/major features (highest visibility)
2. Package consolidations (import path changes)
3. New APIs (hooks, controller methods, schemas)
4. Other Improvements (bulleted list)
5. Breaking Changes (with anchor links to migration sections)

**Details (after truncate):**
1. Major features (with `<StackBlitz>`, `<HooksPlayground>` demos)
2. New/changed APIs (with `<TypeScriptEditor>` examples)
3. Performance (with mermaid charts if benchmarked)
4. Other improvements
5. Migration guide

Within each section: explanation → code example → PR/commit links

## Migration Guide

Start with `<PkgTabs pkgs="..." upgrade />`, end with Upgrade support blurb.

**By Package** - Group changes by package when multiple packages have breaking changes:
- `### @data-client/react X.Y` - Client/Platform changes
- `### @data-client/rest X.Y` - API Definition changes

**By Audience** - Within packages (or standalone), group by who's affected:
- `### For all users` / `#### For all users`
- `### For custom Manager authors {#custom-managers}` - Action/middleware changes
- `### For custom Schema authors {#custom-schemas}` - normalize/denormalize changes

Add skip guidance for specialized sections: "Skip this section if you don't have custom [Managers](/docs/concepts/managers)."

Use `<DiffEditor>` for before/after. End with:

```md
### Upgrade support

As usual, if you have any troubles or questions, feel free to join our [![Chat](https://img.shields.io/discord/768254430381735967.svg?style=flat-square&colorB=758ED3)](https://discord.gg/wXGV27xm6t) or [file a bug](https://github.com/reactive/data-client/issues/new/choose)
```

## Components

| Component | Use For |
|-----------|---------|
| `<HooksPlayground>` | Interactive demos with fixtures |
| `<StackBlitz>` | Embedded app demos (todo-app, coin-app) |
| `<TypeScriptEditor>` | Type-safe code examples |
| `<DiffEditor>` | Before/After migration changes |
| `<PkgTabs pkgs="..." upgrade />` | Package installation |
| `<AutoPlayVideo>` | SSR/navigation demos |

## Performance Sections

1. Explain what was optimized
2. Quantify with multipliers ("2x", "16x")
3. Link PR and docs
4. Visualize with mermaid `xychart-beta` bar chart (baseline at 100)
5. Link to [benchmarks](https://reactive.github.io/data-client/dev/bench/)

## Conventions

- Each change links to PR `[#1234](https://github.com/reactive/data-client/pull/1234)` and relevant docs
- Use `:::note` / `:::tip` / `:::warning` for callouts
- Use `// highlight-next-line` for code emphasis
- Imports go after frontmatter; place migration-only imports after truncate
